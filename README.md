# Input
The input for this program is hard-coded resume data including name, contact information, education, skills, work experience, and projects. The data is displayed using a React component.

# Process
The program is a React web app structured with a main component `Resume.js`. This component is imported into `App.js` and rendered. Styling is applied using an external CSS file `Resume.css`, which sets background color, font, and layout. React processes the JSX structure and renders it as standard HTML/CSS in the browser.

# Output
The final output is a visually styled resume web page with a bright green (`#bdfb04`) background and black text. The layout includes clearly defined sections for each resume category, displayed in a clean and centered format as shown in the example image.
